# Password-Generator

Hey!ðŸ™Œ

This has been a wonderful journey in learning JavaScript so far. 
Everyday has been challenging but the best way to learn is to do projects, lots of them!

Today I just made my own password generator which works based on the preset length of the password string.
This can be used to generate a series of strings as required.

While doing this project the thing I found the most challenging was building the UI.
It has a minimal look that matches with the tone of the application.
Will be adding more features soon.

Password Generator done.
More to come!ðŸ¤ž
